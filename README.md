# project_euler

Here I upload some of my solutions to Project Euler problems using Python. Most of them are from myself, some of them are done using hints.

## Incomplete list of my favourite problems

So far, my documentation about my solutions has been rather scarce, so my plan is to improve this
moving forward. One reason is that it has been quite a long time since I have worked on many of
these problems and I have probably forgotten a lot about how I solved some of the problems.
The second reasons is that for anybody except me it must be even harder to follow what I did.
I am starting by adding small write ups for some of my favourite problems to this README as a
first attempt to be more clear about my solutions.

### Problem 185

Coming soon

## Concepts I have used:

* Markov Chains
* Genetic Algorithms
* Monte Carlo
* Dynamic Programming
* Hidden Markov Models
